            <p>Welcome to FayMay Fansite. This page is maintained by international fans. We are glad that you are curious about FayMay and want to know more about them. We would like to request just five things from you.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>FayMay is one. Please learn to love them both.</li>
                <li>Please love and accept both Fay and May as who they are, not your idea of who they should be.</li>
                <li>Please respect and support their decisions, be it for work or personal life.</li>
                <li>Please respect their privacy and know our boundaries as fans and artists. They love to share their lives with us, but that doesn't mean we can overstep our boundaries. That includes their relationship with other people, be it other public figures or private citizens. Respect the relationship they have with others and give them their privacy.</li>
                <li>Please try not to amplify the voices of the haters, drown them out with love instead. Our fandom is built on love, but if someone means to cause harm, we will protect FayMay.</li>
